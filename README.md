# Weather<3usic

**Play a random happy music from a local artist from youtube if the weather is good**
**Play a random shitty depressing song from a local artist from youtube if the weather is bad**

### To fix

* Error when null input (Ask to people)
* Think about a better passion project (OOJS)
* Parse sunrise/sunset data (Ask to people)

### To implement:

* Take care of the user musical choices (wiki?)
* Use Youtube API ASAP (done, works, dope!)
* Play youtube video as backgorund (cheap, lets go with a single line of text such as playing > ...)
* Find user location automatically (that's not cool, we need UX!)

### To do

* Deploy on heroku -> Failed (because of gitignore, add keys in heroku admin panel)
* Have fun trying to use Heroku mobile instructon to implement a mobile version even if totally -> next week
* Use wikipedia api to find a random local artist from the location picked by the user, user this variable to querry a song (prob the most famous since the first) on youtube
